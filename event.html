         <!-- <P>The 2016 Music For The Arts concert and benefit will take place DATE AND TIME at LOCATION. </p>-->
          <p>In an effort to bring together local artists and musicians, the Cullen family will host its 9th annual Music For The Arts on Jan. 16, 2016.</p> 
          <p>Our annual event affords artists the opportunity to donate or display their work at the benefit while local musicians take the stage. The concept is to create a gallery and concert in one. So if you are a photographer, painter, or any other kind of artist, this is a great opportunity to network and get your art out there for people to see.</p> 
          <p>Friends, family, newcomers and neighbors are invited to enjoy the sounds and take in some culture.</p> 
          <p>$15 entrance fee/donation will be accepted at the door. All donations will be made in the name of our sister, daughter, cousin and friend to many &mdash; Christina Marie Cullen. She was a gifted artist, photographer and musician and this is the only true way to honor her life.</p>

          <p>In addition, we are always looking for donations of all kinds &mdash; big or small &mdash; for our raffle and auction. It's a great way to represent your business or art with this local community gathering.</p>
          <p>If you are interested in participating or donating, please contact Jason Cullen at <a href="mailto:jasoncullen78@gmail.com">jasoncullen78@gmail.com</a>. (You may need to bring supports/tables/etc. to hang your work.)</p><br><br>

                  </a>
                  <p>Affectionately known by all who love him as Griz (and currently performing under that pseudonym), singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, Chris Grunwald, is a maverick in the Philadelphia music community. Loosely described as an Americana-Folk artist, his work defies an easy pigeonhole as it effortlessly pushes the boundaries of compatible genres including reggae, rock, alternative and country, while still maintaining his unique and recognizable signature sounds.</p>

                  </a>
                  <p>Formed in 2011, Next Wednesday is a band of musical brethren whose sounds are influenced by the behemoths of rock and roll and nuanced by their passion for folk, blues, pop, and improvisational jams. Despite their limited appearances, their fan-base continues to grow exponentially, largely due to the popularity of their annual Black Friday show which draws hundreds of people from throughout the Delaware Valley to experience a memorable night of the band's unique interpretations of songs from the most prolific and iconic rock bands in history.</p>
